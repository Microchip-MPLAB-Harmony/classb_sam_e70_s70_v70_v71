# CLASSB\_Startup\_Tests

**Function**

```c
static CLASSB_STARTUP_STATUS CLASSB_Startup_Tests(void);
```

**Summary**

This function executes all startup self-tests inserted into classb.c file by the MHC.

**Description**

This function is called from the '\_on\_reset' function which is the first function to be executed after a reset. If none of the self-tests are failed, this function returns 'CLASSB\_STARTUP\_TEST\_PASSED'. If any of the startup self-tests are failed, this function will not return. The self-tests for SRAM, Clock and Interrupt are considered non-critical since it may be possible to execute a fail-safe function after detecting a failure. In such case, the CLASSB\_SelfTest\_FailSafe\(\) function is called when a failure is detected. In the case of critical failures \(CPU registers or internal flash\), the corresponding self-test remains in an infinite loop to avoid unsafe execution of code.

**Precondition**

None.

**Parameters**

None.

**Returns**

Pass or Fail.

**Example**

```c
CLASSB_STARTUP_STATUS startup_tests_status = CLASSB_STARTUP_TEST_FAILED;
startup_tests_status = CLASSB_Startup_Tests();
```

**Remarks**

This function does not return if any of the self-tests detects a failure.
