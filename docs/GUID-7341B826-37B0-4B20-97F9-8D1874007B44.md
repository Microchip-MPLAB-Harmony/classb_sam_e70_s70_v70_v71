# CLASSB\_ClockTest

**Function**

```c
CLASSB_TEST_STATUS CLASSB_ClockTest(uint32_t cpu_clock_freq, uint8_t error_limit, uint16_t clock_test_RTT_cycles, bool running_context);
```

**Summary**

This self-test checks whether the CPU clock frequency is within the permissible limit.

**Description**

This self-test uses RTT and SysTick to measure the CPU clock frequency. The RTT is clocked at 32768 Hz from the XOSC32K and CPU clock can be from any other high frequency oscillator. If the CPU clock frequency is within specified error limit, it returns PASS. The test duration is defined by the value of rtc\_cycles. The RTT is configured to take clock from an external 32.768 kHz accurate crystal.

**Precondition**

None.

**Parameters**

*cpu\_clock\_freq* - Expected CPU clock frequency.

*error\_limit* - Permissible error limit \(eg; 5 means +-5 percent\).

*clock\_test\_rtc\_cycles* - The test duration in terms of RTT cycles.

*running\_context* - False for startup test. True for run-time test.

**Returns**

*CLASSB\_TEST\_STATUS* - Status of the test.

**Example**

```c
CLASSB_TEST_STATUS classb_test_status = CLASSB_TEST_NOT_EXECUTED;
// Perform run-time test of the CPU clock
classb_test_status = CLASSB_ClockTest(300000000, 5, 500, true);
```

**Remarks**

This self-test can be used during startup as well as run-time. This self-test shall be used only if there is an external 32.768 kHz accurate crystal connected to the XOSC32K of the microcontroller.
