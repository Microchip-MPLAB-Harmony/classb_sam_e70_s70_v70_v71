# CLASSB\_SST\_InterruptTest

**Function**

```c
CLASSB_TEST_STATUS CLASSB_SST_InterruptTest(void);
```

**Summary**

This self-test checks basic functionality of the interrupt handling mechanism.

**Description**

This self-test configures the Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller \(NVIC\), the RTC peripheral and the TC0 peripheral to test the interrupt handling mechanism of the microcontroller. It verifies that at least one interrupt is generated and handled properly. This self-test also checks whether the number of interrupts generated are too many within a given time period. It reports a PASS if the RTC has generated at least one interrupt and the total number of interrupts generated by the TC0 is less than the specified upper limit and greater than one. The clock used for RTC is 1kHz from the internal OSCULP32K and for TC0, the clock is same as the default CPU clock \(48MHz from the DFLL48M\).

**Precondition**

None.

**Parameters**

None.

**Returns**

*CLASSB\_TEST\_STATUS* - Status of the test.

**Example**

```c
CLASSB_TEST_STATUS classb_test_status = CLASSB_TEST_NOT_EXECUTED;
// Perform test of the Interrupt mechanism at start-up
classb_test_status = CLASSB_SST_InterruptTest();
```

**Remarks**

This self-test can be used only during startup.
